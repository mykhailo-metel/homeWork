 Print name + NO of withdrawal fs not possible and name + sum of withdrawal + balance after withdrawal in other case.
 Comision is 5% for all cases.

 int[] balances = {1200, 250, 2000, 500, 3200};
 String[] ownerNames = {"Jane", "Ann", "Jack", "Oww", "Lane"};
 String ownerName = Ann
 double withdrawal = 100;
 Output
 Ann 100 145
 Input
 int[] balances = {1200, 250, 2000, 500, 3200};
 String[] ownerNames = {"Jane", "Ann", "Jack", "Oww", "Lane"};
 String ownerName = Oww
